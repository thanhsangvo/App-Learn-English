# Implementation Plan - Add Shop Items Collection

The goal is to add the "Shop Items" collection to the FireCMS project so it matches the Firestore structure and appears in the CMS dashboard.

## Proposed Changes

### FireCMS

#### [NEW] [shop_items.tsx](file:///Users/devsang/Developer/App Learn English/FireCMS/src/collections/shop_items.tsx)
Create a new collection file for shop items with the following properties (based on [ShopItemModel](file:///Users/devsang/Developer/App%20Learn%20English/lib/data/models/shop_item_model.dart#2-58)):
- `id` (string)
- `name` (string)
- `assetPath` (string, with storage config if needed)
- [price](file:///Users/devsang/Developer/App%20Learn%20English/FireCMS/src/collections/demo.tsx#26-41) (number)
- `type` (string, with enum values like 'hat', 'glasses', etc.)
- `category` (string, with enum values like 'normal', 'event_summer', etc.)
- `dx` (number)
- `dy` (number)
- `scale` (number)
- `isOnline` (boolean)

#### [MODIFY] [App.tsx](file:///Users/devsang/Developer/App Learn English/FireCMS/src/App.tsx)
- Import `shopItemsCollection` from `./collections/shop_items`.
- Add `shopItemsCollection` to the `collections` array in the `useMemo` hook.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Run the FireCMS app locally (`npm run dev`).
2. Verify that "Shop Items" appears in the sidebar and the dashboard.
3. Click on "Shop Items" and verify that it correctly displays items from the `shop_items` collection in Firestore.
4. Try to edit an item to ensure the schema matches.
