# FireCMS & Firestore Integration Walkthrough

## 🎉 Changes Overview
We have successfully integrated **Firebase Firestore** to replace the hardcoded vocabulary data. The app now fetches data from the cloud, enabling dynamic updates without releasing new app versions.

### Key Features
- **Cloud Firestore**: Stores Topics and Vocabularies.
- **Offline Support**: Data is cached locally, so the app works even without internet.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Changes in Firestore/FireCMS reflect in the app immediately (on next restart/reload).
- **Fallback**: If Firestore is empty or unreachable on first run, acts like before (using local defaults).

## 🚀 How to Manage Content (FireCMS)

Since we now have the data in Firestore, you can set up **FireCMS** to manage it visually.

### Option 1: FireCMS Cloud (Easiest)
1. Go to [app.firecms.co](https://app.firecms.co).
2. Create an account and **New Project**.
3. Connect your Firebase Project (`app-learn-english-flutter`).
4. You will see your `topics` collection immediately!

### Option 2: Self-hosted (Ready!)
I have already set up a local FireCMS project for you in the `admin` folder.

#### To start the Admin Panel:
1. Open a new terminal.
2. Navigate to the admin folder: `cd admin`
3. Start the server: `npm run dev`
4. Open the link (usually http://localhost:5173).
5. Log in with Google (ensure your account has access to the Firebase project).

You can now edit Topics and Vocabularies visually! Changes will sync to the app immediately.

## 🛠 Verification Steps

### 1. Check App Functionality
- Run the app: `flutter run`
- Verify that Topics (Animals, Colors, etc.) load correctly.
- **Offline Test**: Turn off WiFi/Data -> Restart App -> Topics should still load from cache/fallback.

### 2. Modify Data
1. Go to [Firebase Console > Firestore](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Edit a Topic name (e.g., change "Animals" to "Amazing Animals").
3. Restart the app.
4. Verify the name change is reflected!

### 3. Check Code Updates
- [lib/data/repositories/firestore_vocabulary_repository.dart](file:///Users/devsang/Developer/App%20Learn%20English/lib/data/repositories/firestore_vocabulary_repository.dart): New logic for fetching data.
- [lib/data/models/topic_model.dart](file:///Users/devsang/Developer/App%20Learn%20English/lib/data/models/topic_model.dart): Added `fromFirestore` / [toFirestore](file:///Users/devsang/Developer/App%20Learn%20English/lib/data/models/topic_model.dart#126-136).
- [lib/main.dart](file:///Users/devsang/Developer/App%20Learn%20English/lib/main.dart): Initialized Firebase and Repository.

## 📝 Note on "Seed"
We already ran the seed script to upload your existing hardcoded data to Firestore. The database is populated!
